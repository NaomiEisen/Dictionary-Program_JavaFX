# Dictionary-Program_JavaFX
This JavaFX application provides a user-friendly interface for managing a dictionary. It includes features such as adding, deleting, editing, searching, and resetting elements in the dictionary. Additionally, there's an 'auto-fill' feature that populates the dictionary with pre-made elements for easy testing.

## Task Information
This project was developed as part of the Open University Java course task on Advanced Programming with Java.
